      <h2>What is Pairwise Comparison?</h2>
      <p>When choosing between many different options, decisions can become challenging, especially if your choices are quite different from one another, if decision criteria are subjective, or if you don't have objective data to use for your decision.</p>
      <p>Pairwise Comparison helps you work out the importance of a number of options relative to one another, and makes it easy to choose the most important problem to solve, or pick the solution that will be most effective and help you set priorities.</p>
      <p>For example, it can be useful to decide the relative importance of qualifications, skills, experience and teamworking ability when hiring people for a new role.</p>
